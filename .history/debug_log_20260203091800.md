# Debug Log

## 2026-02-03
- **Task**: Initialize MVP for Cat Thoughts Reader
- **Status**: MVP Implemented (with Mock Fallback)
- **Notes**: 
    - Received product brief and OpenAPI spec.
    - Implemented Backend: FastAPI (`main.py`)
        - Handles image upload.
        - Attempts to call `student-api.ai-builders.space`.
        - **Issue**: SSL/Connection errors with the provided API endpoint in the current environment (resolves to 127.0.0.1 locally).
        - **Solution**: Implemented a fallback mechanism. If the API fails, it returns a mock humorous response so the frontend flow is not blocked.
        - API Key configured.
    - Implemented Frontend: HTML/JS/CSS (`static/`)
        - Clean, WeChat-mini-program-like UI.
        - Supports image upload and preview.
        - Displays analysis result.
        - Supports saving result as a card (using html2canvas).
    - Verified:
        - Server starts successfully.
        - API endpoint `/api/analyze` accepts images and returns JSON.
        - Fallback logic works correctly when remote API is unreachable.
