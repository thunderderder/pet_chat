## 2026-02-03 Refactoring: Extract Hardcoded Keys to .env

**Reason:**
User requested to move hardcoded keys (specifically `API_KEY`) out of the codebase and into a `.env` file for security and configuration flexibility.

**Changes:**
1.  Created `.env` file in the project root.
2.  Added `API_KEY`, `API_BASE_URL`, and `VERIFY_SSL` to `.env`.
3.  Modified `main.py`:
    -   Imported `load_dotenv` from `dotenv`.
    -   Called `load_dotenv()` at the beginning of the script.
    -   Replaced hardcoded `API_KEY` with `os.getenv("API_KEY")`.
    -   Ensured `API_BASE_URL` and `VERIFY_SSL` are also consistently loaded from env vars.
