# Debug Log

## 2026-02-03 (Updated)
- **Task**: Initialize MVP for Cat Thoughts Reader
- **Status**: MVP Implemented (with Mock Fallback)
- **API Issue Diagnosis**:
    - **Symptom**: `student-api.ai-builders.space` resolves to `45.63.66.158` (Vultr/Choopa), but ping times out. `requests` reports SSL errors and connection to `127.0.0.1`.
    - **Analysis**:
        - `nslookup` shows `45.63.66.158` (Public IP).
        - However, `requests` log shows `Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host '127.0.0.1'`.
        - This strongly suggests a local proxy, VPN, or firewall rule is intercepting traffic and redirecting it to localhost, or there's a split-horizon DNS issue in the specific Python environment/network stack.
        - `ai-builders.space` returns HTML (Circle.so community platform), not the backend API.
    - **Conclusion**: The provided API endpoint is unreachable from the current environment due to network/DNS configuration or server-side firewall blocking ICMP/HTTPs from this IP.
    - **Workaround**: Continued use of Mock Fallback for MVP demonstration.

- **Notes**: 
    - Received product brief and OpenAPI spec.
    - Implemented Backend: FastAPI (`main.py`)
        - Handles image upload.
        - Attempts to call `student-api.ai-builders.space`.
        - **Solution**: Implemented a fallback mechanism. If the API fails, it returns a mock humorous response so the frontend flow is not blocked.
        - API Key configured.
    - Implemented Frontend: HTML/JS/CSS (`static/`)
        - Clean, WeChat-mini-program-like UI.
        - Supports image upload and preview.
        - Displays analysis result.
        - Supports saving result as a card (using html2canvas).
    - Verified:
        - Server starts successfully.
        - API endpoint `/api/analyze` accepts images and returns JSON.
        - Fallback logic works correctly when remote API is unreachable.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Open browser: `http://localhost:8000`
